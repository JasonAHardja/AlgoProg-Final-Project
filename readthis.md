### Information 
This a game made using Pygame in python. This is just a simple and not over the top fighting style game that I have created for this Algorithm and Programming class. This project contains only one .py file and 3 images for the player, opponent, and background.

### How to Start
After downloading everything here, just hit the run button and start playing. If the game closes after losing or winning, it is fine because it is built-in the game. If you want to change it, you may check the report.


I aplogize in advance for the making of this decent and small game, I am still learning and may make a better project in the future.
